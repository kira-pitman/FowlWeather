# WEATHER APP

## LET'S GET STARTED
git clone SSH  
npm install  
npm run dev  

OR  

Visit the deployed app here (url to come!)

## PURPOSE
I wanted to have a play around with external API's again, and try to make a weather app - I haven't done any location based API's or apps before so wanted to explore the data structure and the information given in these APIs. I also wanted to learn a bit more about including animations into websites using three.js / react three fiber, as never got a proper deep dive during my final group project! Thought it would also be fun to have it fowl themed e.g. geese, ducks, etc... responding to weather forecasts!

## MVP
Lets user look at different locations weather forecast for the day  
Is fully accessible in the Front End  

## STRETCH
Has minimum 75% serverside testing coverage  
Lets user choose location for weather forecast  
Lets user choose length of forecase at chosen location  
Has an animated model for weather forecast  
Have three.js modeled images for weather forecast i.e. goose with rainjacket, chicken holding ice cream in the sun, duck under clouds, turkey in tornado etc...
